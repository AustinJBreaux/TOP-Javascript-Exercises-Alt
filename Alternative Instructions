I tried for 2 days to get the test environment working, something seems off with it, so I'm just gonna do them through a local hosted website html/js file. 
It works! Can't test using jest like TOP says, but Jest isn't working, so I have to rely on the spec.js files for expected test results 
--------------------------------------------------------
To use this, go in the Exercises folder. Open the Javascript_Exercises_Alt.html file in VSCode, and launch the locally hosted browser via the extension
For each exercise you want to test, copy the name of the .js file of the exercise to the <script src = ##_fileName.js> element of the html file
If you're editing/testing code, use the in-browser terminal
Test against the expected rules/results of the numbered exercise's spec.js file, located in javascript-exercises/TOP-javascript-exercises
